# GeoCoding
Contains examples of using GeoCodio batch geocoding facilities in concert with APEX_JSON and APEX_WEBSERVICE 
to request and retrieve multiple latitude/longitude pairs for APEX applications.

More information about GeoCodio's relatively low-cost services are here: https://geocod.io

Note that the two PNGs are screen shots of the APEX Web Service Module (WSM) I set up within my application's
Shared Components to allow processing of the GeoCodio geocoding service. You will need to request your own
API key from GeoCodio to make these code samples work and include them in appropriate locations in the WSM
setup as well as the PL/SQL code itself.
